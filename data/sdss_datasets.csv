37,,"X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is dominated by the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The radio luminosity, however, has not such a clear origin except in the most powerful sources where jets are evident. The origin (and even the very existence) of the local bi-modal distribution in radio-loudness is also a debated issue. By analyzing X-ray, optical and radio properties of a large sample of type 1 AGN and quasars (QSOs) up to z &gt; 2, where the bulk of this population resides, the authors aim to explore the interplay between radio and X-ray emission in AGN, in order to further our knowledge on the origin of radio emission, and its relation to accretion. They analyze a large (~800 sources) sample of type 1 AGN and QSOs selected from the 2XMMi XMM-Newton X-ray source catalog, cross-correlated with the SDSS DR7 spectroscopic catalog, covering a redshift range from z ~ 0.3 to z ~ 2.3. Supermassive black hole masses are estimated from the Mg II emission line, bolometric luminosities from the X-ray data, and radio emission or upper limits from the FIRST catalog. Most of the sources accrete close to the Eddington limit and the distribution in radio-loudness does not appear to have a bi-modal behavior. This study confirms that radio-loud AGN are also X-ray loud, with an X-ray-to-optical ratio up to twice that of radio-quiet objects, even excluding the most extreme strongly jetted sources. By analyzing complementary radio-selected control samples, the authors find evidence that these conclusions are not an effect of the X-ray selection, but are likely a property of the dominant QSO population. The authors of this catalog conclude that their findings are best interpreted in a context where radio emission in AGN, with the exception of a minority of beamed sources, arises from very close to the accretion disk and is therefore heavily linked to X-ray emission. They also speculate that the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy might either be an evolutionary effect that developed well after the QSO peak epoch, or an effect of incompleteness in small samples. Basic information and derived properties are presented for the sample of X-ray selected type 1 AGN (as well as for the 11 X-ray undetected type 1 AGN in the &quot;control sample&quot;): coordinates, redshift, X-ray and radio fluxes, optical magnitudes, from the SDSS, 2XMMi, and FIRST catalogs; continuum luminosities at 3000 Angstroms and in the X-ray band, black hole masses, bolometric luminosities, Eddington ratios; for the sources falling in the FIRST field, optical fluxes at 2500 and 4400 Angstroms, X-ray-to-optical index, radio classification, and the ratios between the radio and the UV, optical, and X-ray fluxes.",,,,,,,,,,agnsdssxm2,,,,https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/tap,2012A&amp;A...545A..66B,AGNSDSSXM2,,,,ivo://nasa.heasarc/agnsdssxm2,,,,,,,,,,,Catalog/nasa.heasarc,"['optical', 'radio', 'x-ray']",https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/cone?showoffsets&table=agnsdssxm2&,,1655156341000.0,https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/agnsdssxm2.html,nasa.heasarc/agnsdssxm2,,Sloan Digital Sky Survey/XMM-Newton Type1 AGN X-Ray and Radio Properties Catalog,

The sample consists of 359 sources selected in the hard 2 - 8 keV band, spanning the flux range from 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-16&lt;/sup&gt; - 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt; erg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s with a high rate of spectroscopic or photometric redshift completeness (100 and 85 percent for the Chandra and XMM-Newton data, respectively). The authors derive the column density values using X-ray spectral fits. They find that the fraction of obscured AGN falls with increasing luminosity in agreement with previous findings. The fraction of obscured AGN shows an apparent increase at high redshifts (z &gt; 2). Simulations show that this effect can most probably be attributed to the fact that at high redshifts the column densities are overestimated.

39,,"The combination of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP; Green et al. 2004, ApJS, 150, 43) currently offers the largest and most homogeneously selected sample of nearby galaxies for investigating the relations between X-ray nuclear emission, nebular line emission, black hole masses, and the properties of the associated stellar populations. The authors provide X-ray spectral fits and valid uncertainties for all the galaxies with counts ranging from 2 to 1325 (mean 76, median 19). They present in their paper novel constraints that both X-ray luminosity L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; and X-ray spectral energy distribution bring to the galaxy evolutionary sequence HII -&gt; Seyfert/Transition Object -&gt; LINER -&gt; Passive suggested by optical data. In particular, the authors show that both L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; and Gamma, the slope of the power law that best fits the 0.5 - 8 keV spectra, are consistent with a clear decline in the accretion power along the sequence, corresponding to a softening of their spectra. This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) levels, there is an anticorrelation between Gamma and L/L&lt;sub&gt;Edd&lt;/sub&gt;, opposite to the trend which is exhibited by high-z AGN (quasars). The turning point in the Gamma - L/L&lt;sub&gt;Edd&lt;/sub&gt; LLAGN + quasars relation occurs near Gamma ~ 1.5 and L/L&lt;sub&gt;Edd&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 0.01. Interestingly, this is identical to what stellar mass X-ray binaries exhibit, indicating that the authors have probably found the first empirical evidence for an intrinsic switch in the accretion mode, from advection-dominated flows to standard (disk/corona) accretion modes in supermassive black hole accretors, similar to what has been seen and proposed to happen in stellar mass black hole systems. The anticorrelation the authors find between Gamma and L/L&lt;sub&gt;Edd&lt;/sub&gt; may instead indicate that stronger accretion correlates with greater absorption. Therefore, the trend for softer spectra toward more luminous, high-redshift, and strongly accreting (L/L&lt;sub&gt;Edd&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;~ 0.01) AGNs/quasars could simply be the result of strong selection biases reflected in the dearth of type 2 quasar detections. The cross-match of all ChaMP sky regions imaged by Chandra/ACIS with the SDSS DR4 spectroscopic footprint results in a parent sample of 15,955 galaxies on or near a chip and a subset of 199 sources that are X-ray detected. Among those, only 107 sources have an off-axis angle (OAA) Theta &lt;0.2 degrees and avoid ccd=8 due to high serial readout noise; these 107 objects comprise the main sample that the authors employ for this study and that are listed in this table. The authors performed direct spectral fits to the X-ray counts distribution using the full instrument calibration, known redshift, and Galactic 21-cm column nH&lt;sub&gt;Gal&lt;/sub&gt;. Source spectra were extracted from circular regions with radii corresponding to energy encircled fractions of ~90%, while the background region encompasses a 20 arcsec annulus, centered on the source, with separation 4 arcsecs, from the source region. Any nearby sources were excised, from both the source and the background regions. The spectral fitting was done via yaxx ('Yet Another X-ray eXtractor': Aldcroft 2006, BAAS, 38, 376), an automated script that employs the CIAO Sherpa tool. Each spectrum was fitted in the range 0.5 - 8 keV by two different models: (1) a single power law plus absorption fixed at the Galactic 21-cm value (model 'PL'), and (2) a fixed power law of photon index Gamma = 1.9 plus intrinsic absorption of column nH (model 'PLfix'). For the nine objects with more than 200 counts, the authors employed a third model in which both the slope of the power law and the intrinsic absorption were free to vary (model 'PL_abs').",,,,,,,,,,champsdssa,,,,https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/tap,2009ApJ...705.1336C,CHAMPSDSSA,,,,ivo://nasa.heasarc/champsdssa,,,,,,,,,,,Catalog/nasa.heasarc,x-ray,https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/cone?showoffsets&table=champsdssa&,,1655156342000.0,https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/champsdssa.html,nasa.heasarc/champsdssa,,CHAMP/SDSS Nearby Low-Luminosity AGN Catalog,

Of the 6371 SDSS DR3 quasars covered by 204 GALEX GR1 tiles and listed in this table, 5380 (84%) have near-UV detections, while 3034 (48%) have both near-UV and far-UV detections using a matching radius of 7 arcseconds. Most of the DR3 sample quasars are detected in the near-UV until z ~ 1.7, with the near-UV detection fraction dropping to ~50% by z ~ 2. Statistical tests performed on the distributions of non-detections indicate that the optically selected quasars missed in the UV tend to be optically faint or at high redshift. The GALEX positions are shown to be consistent with the SDSS astrometry to within an rms scatter of 0.6 - 0.7 arcsecs in each coordinate, and the empirically determined photometric errors from multi-epoch GALEX observations significantly exceed the Poissonian errors quoted in the GR1 object catalogs. The UV-detected quasars are well separated from stars in UV-optical color-color space, with the UV-optical relative colors suggesting a marginally detected population of reddened objects due to absorption along the line of sight or dust associated with the quasar. The resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) cover ~350 - 9000 Angstroms (rest frame), where the overall median SED peaks near the Lyman-Alpha emission line, as found in other UV quasar studies. The large sample size allows the authors to construct median SEDs in small bins of redshift and luminosity, and they find that the median SED becomes harder (bluer) at UV wavelengths for quasars with lower continuum luminosity.

43,,"The ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) was the first imaging X-ray survey of the entire sky. Combining the RASS Bright and Faint Source Catalogs yields an average of about three X-ray sources per square degree. However, while X-ray source counterparts are known to range from distant quasars to nearby M dwarfs, the RASS data alone are often insufficient to determine the nature of an X-ray source. As a result, large-scale follow-up programs are required to construct samples of known X-ray emitters. The authors use optical data produced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to identify 709 stellar X-ray emitters cataloged in the RASS and falling within the SDSS Data Release 1 footprint. Most of these are bright stars with coronal X-ray emission unsuitable for SDSS spectroscopy, which is designed for fainter objects (g &gt; 15&lt;sup&gt;mag&lt;/sup&gt;). Instead, the authors use SDSS photometry, correlations with the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and other catalogs, and spectroscopy from the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope to identify these stellar X-ray counterparts. Their sample of 707 X-ray-emitting F, G, K, and M stars is one of the largest X-ray-selected samples of such stars.

According to the reference paper (but see HEASARC Caveats section below), this catalog contains 817 clusters (473 at redshift z &lt;= 0.12) with S/N &gt; 3 for their X-ray detections (an additional 12,629 clusters have 3 &gt;= S/N &gt; 1 and 21,076 clusters have 1 &gt;= S/N &gt; 0). The authors find about 65% of these X-ray clusters have their most massive member located near the X-ray flux peak; for the remaining 35%, the most massive galaxy is separated from the X-ray peak, with the separation following a distribution expected from a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. In the reference paper, the authors investigate a number of correlations between the optical and X-ray properties of these X-ray clusters, and find that the cluster X-ray luminosity is correlated with the stellar mass (luminosity) of the clusters, as well as with the stellar mass (luminosity) of the central galaxy and the mass of the halo, although the scatter in these correlations is large. Comparing the properties of X-ray clusters of similar halo masses but having different X-ray luminosities, they find that massive haloes with masses &gt;~10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt; contain a larger fraction of red satellite galaxies when they are brighter in X-ray.

45,,"This table contains a catalog of 5035 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars (QSOs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) QSO catalog that have absorption troughs covering a continuous velocity range greater than or equal to 2000 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The authors have fitted ultraviolet (UV) continua and line emission in each case, enabling them to report common diagnostics of BAL strengths and velocities in the range from -25,000 to 0 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for Si IV 1400 Angstroms, C IV 1549 A, Al III 1857 A, and Mg II 2799 A. The authors calculate these diagnostics using the spectrum listed in the DR5 QSO catalog, and also for spectra from additional SDSS observing epochs when available. They confirm and extend previous findings that BAL QSOs are more strongly reddened in the rest-frame UV than non-BAL QSOs, and that BAL QSOs are relatively X-ray weak compared to non-BAL QSOs. The observed BAL fraction is dependent on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (S/N); for higher S/N sources, the authors find an observed BAL fraction of about 15%. BAL QSOs show a similar Baldwin effect as for non-BAL QSOs, in that their C IV emission equivalent widths decrease with increasing continuum luminosity. However, BAL QSOs have weaker C IV emission in general than do non-BAL QSOs. Sources with higher UV luminosities are more likely to have higher-velocity outflows, and the BAL outflow velocity and UV absorption strength are correlated with relative X-ray weakness. These results are in qualitative agreement with models that depend on strong X-ray absorption to shield the outflow from overionization and enable radiative acceleration. In a scenario in which BAL trough shapes are primarily determined by outflow geometry, observed differences in Si IV and C IV trough shapes would suggest that some outflows have ion-dependent structure. The authors fit SDSS spectra using the algorithm of Gibson et al. (2008, ApJ, 675, 985), which we summarize here. For QSOs at z &gt;= 1.7, their continuum model is a power law reddened using the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) reddening curve of Pei (1992, ApJ, 395, 130). For QSOs at lower redshifts, the authors use a fourth- or sixth-degree polynomial; in their experience this nonphysical model is able to reproduce well the complex continuum at longer wavelengths. They initially fit regions that are generally free from strong absorption or emission features: 1250-1350, 1700-1800, 1950-2200, 2650-2710, 2950-3700, 3950-4050, 4140-4270, 4400-4800, 5100-6400, and &gt; 6900 Angstroms. They then iteratively fit the continuum, ignoring at each step wavelength bins that deviate by more than 3 sigma from the current fit in order to exclude strong absorption and emission features. They fit Voigt profiles to the strongest emission lines expected in the spectrum: Si IV 1400, C IV 1549, Al III 1857, C III 1909, and Mg II 2799. These wavelengths are taken from the SDSS vacuum wavelength list used by the SDSS pipeline to determine emission-line redshifts.

48,,"The authors have studied the spectral energy distributions and evolution of a large sample of optically selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that were observed in 323 Chandra images analyzed by the Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP). Their highest-confidence matched sample (which this HEASARC table comprises) includes 1135 X-ray detected quasars in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 5.4, representing some 36 Msec of effective exposure. In their paper, the authors provide catalogs of QSO properties, and describe their novel method of calculating X-ray flux upper limits and effective sky coverage. Spectroscopic redshifts are available for about 1/3 of the detected sample; elsewhere, redshifts are estimated photometrically. The authors have detected 56 QSOs with redshift z &gt; 3, substantially expanding the known sample. They find no evidence for evolution out to z ~ 5 for either the X-ray photon index Gamma or for the ratio of optical/UV to X-ray flux Alpha_ox. About 10% of detected QSOs show best-fit intrinsic absorbing columns greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, but the fraction might reach ~1/3 if most nondetections are absorbed. The authors confirm a significant correlation between Alpha_ox and optical luminosity, but it flattens or disappears for fainter (M_B &gt;~ -23) active galactic nucleus (AGN) alone. They report significant hardening of Gamma both toward higher X-ray luminosity, and for relatively X-ray loud quasars. These trends may represent a relative increase in nonthermal X-ray emission, and their findings thereby strengthen analogies between Galactic black hole binaries and AGN. For uniformly selected subsamples of narrow-line Seyfert 1s and narrow absorption line QSOs, they find no evidence for unusual distributions of either Alpha_ox or Gamma.

49,,"The authors report the discovery of 9,088 new spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs and subdwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 10 (DR10). They obtain T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;, log g and masses for hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarf stars (DAs) and helium-atmosphere white dwarf stars (DBs), and estimate the calcium/helium abundances for the white dwarf stars with metallic lines (DZs) and carbon/helium for carbon-dominated spectra (DQs). They found 1 central star of a planetary nebula, 2 new oxygen spectra on helium-atmosphere white dwarfs, 71 DQs, 42 hot DO/PG1159s, 171 white dwarf+main-sequence star binaries, 206 magnetic DAHs, 327 continuum-dominated DCs, 397 metal-polluted white dwarfs, 450 helium-dominated white dwarfs, 647 subdwarfs and 6887 new hydrogen-dominated white dwarf stars. The targeted white dwarfs were required to be point sources with clean photometry, and to have USNO-B Catalog counterparts (Monet et al.. 2003, AJ, 125, 984, CDS Cat. I/284). They were also restricted to regions inside the DR7 imaging footprint and required to have colors within the ranges g &lt; 19.2, (u-r) &lt; 0.4, -1 &lt; (u-g) &lt; 0.3, -1 &lt; (g-r) &lt; 0.5 and to have low Galactic extinction A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0.5 mag. Additionally, targets that did not have (u-r) &lt; -0.1 and (g-r) &lt; -0.1 were required to have USNO proper motions larger than 2 arcseconds per century (20 milliarcseconds per year). Objects satisfying the selection criteria that had not been observed previously by the SDSS were denoted by the WHITEDWARF_NEW target flag, while those with prior SDSS spectra are assigned the WHITEDWARF_SDSS flag. Some of the latter were re-observed with BOSS in order to obtain the extended wavelength coverage that the BOSS spectrograph offers. The color selection used includes DA stars with temperatures above ~14,000 K, helium-atmosphere white dwarfs above ~8000 K, as well as many rarer classes of white dwarfs. Hot subdwarfs (sdB and sdO) were targeted as well. Note that this catalog does not include stars from the earlier SDSS white dwarf catalogs, e.g., Eisenstein et al. (2006, ApJS, 167, 40, available in the HEASARC database as the SDSSDWDSD table), Kleinman et al.

These numbers represent more than a factor of two increase in the total number of white dwarf stars from the previous SDSS white dwarf catalogs based on DR4 data. The distribution of subtypes varies from previous catalogs due to the authors' more conservative, manual classifications of each star in our catalog, supplementing their automatic fits. In particular, they find a large number of magnetic white dwarf stars whose small Zeeman splittings mimic increased Stark broadening that would otherwise result in an overestimated log g if fit as a non-magnetic white dwarf. The authors calculate mean DA and DB masses for their clean, non-magnetic sample and find the DB mean mass is statistically larger than that for the DAs.

51,,"This table contains a catalog of over 130,000 quasar candidates with near-infrared (NIR) photometric properties, with an areal coverage of approximately 1200 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is achieved by matching the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the optical ugriz bands to the UKIRT Infrared Digital Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS) in the NIR YJHK bands. The authors match the ~1 million SDSS DR6 Photometric Quasar catalog to Data Release 3 of the UKIDSS LAS (ULAS) and produce a catalog with 130,827 objects with detections in one or more NIR bands, of which 74,351 objects have optical and K-band detections and 42,133 objects have the full nine-band photometry. The majority (~85%) of the SDSS objects were not matched simply because these were not covered by the ULAS. The positional standard deviation of the SDSS Quasar to ULAS matches is 0.1370 arcseconds in RA and 0.1314 arcseconds in Dec. The authors find an absolute systematic astrometric offset between the SDSS Quasar catalog and the UKIDSS LAS, of |RA offset| = 0.025 arcseconds and |Dec offset| = 0.040 arcseconds; they suggest the nature of this offset to be due to the matching of catalog, rather than image, level data. Their matched catalog has a surface density of ~53 deg&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; for K &lt;= 18.27 objects; tests using this matched catalog, along with data from the UKIDSS Deep Extragalactic Survey, imply that its limiting magnitude is i ~ 20.6.

52,,"This table contains a catalog of 1,015,082 quasar candidates selected from the photometric imaging data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using a non-parametric Bayesian classification kernel density estimator (NBC-KDE). It excludes 157,075 initial candidates that were culled as known or likely contaminants. The objects are all point sources to a limiting magnitude of i = 21.3 from 8417 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of imaging from SDSS Data Release 6 (DR6). This sample extends the previous catalog (Paper I: Richards et al. 2004, ApJS, 155, 257) by using the latest SDSS public release data and probing both ultraviolet (UV)-excess and high-redshift quasars. While the addition of high-redshift candidates reduces the overall efficiency (quasars:quasar candidates) of the catalog to ~80%, it is expected to contain no fewer than 850,000 bona fide quasars, which is ~8 times the number of the previous sample and ~10 times the size of the largest spectroscopic quasar catalog. Cross-matching between this photometric catalog and spectroscopic quasar catalogs from both the SDSS and 2dF survey yields 88,879 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. For judicious selection of the most robust UV-excess sources (~500,000 objects in all), the efficiency is nearly 97 - more than sufficient for detailed statistical analyses. The catalog's completeness to type 1 (broad-line) quasars is expected to be no worse than 70%, with most missing objects occurring at z &lt; 0.7 and 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0. In addition to classification information, the authors provide photometric redshift estimates (typically good to Delta(z) +/- 0.3 [2-sigma]) and cross-matching with radio, X-ray, and proper-motion catalogs. Finally, the authors have considered the catalog's utility for determining the optical luminosity function of quasars and are able to confirm the flattening of the bright-end slope of the quasar luminosity function at z ~ 4 as compared to z ~ 2.

53,,"The Nonparametric Bayes Classifier (NBC) Quasar Candidate Catalog is a catalog of 100,563 unresolved, UV-excess (UVX) quasar candidates with magnitudes to as faint as 21 in the g-band from 2099 square degrees of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release One (DR1) imaging data. Existing spectra of 22,737 sources reveals that 22,191 (97.6%) are quasars; accounting for the magnitude dependence of this efficiency, the authors estimate that 95,502 (95.0%) of the objects in the catalog are quasars. Such a high efficiency is unprecedented in broadband surveys of quasars. This &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; sample is designed to be maximally efficient, but still has 94.7% completeness to unresolved, g ~&lt; 19.5, UVX quasars from the DR1 quasar catalog. This efficient and complete selection is the result of the application of a probability density type analysis to training sets that describe the four-dimensional color distribution of stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the SDSS. Specifically, the authors use a nonparametric Bayesian classification, based on kernel density estimation, to parametrize the color distribution of astronomical sources - allowing for fast and robust classification. They further supplement the catalog by providing photometric redshifts and matches to FIRST/VLA, ROSAT, and USNO-B sources.

The spectra are dominated by either broad absorption lines (42%), unusual red continua (27%), weak emission lines (18%), or conspicuously strong optical and/or UV iron emission (11%). This large sample provides a useful resource for both studying properties and relations of/between different types of unusual quasars and selecting particularly interesting objects, even though the compilation is not aimed at completeness in a quantifiable sense.

It contains 9316 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs which have been selected through photometric cuts and spectroscopic modeling, backed up by a set of visual inspections. About 6000 of the WD stars are new discoveries, roughly doubling the number of spectroscopically confirmed WD stars. The authors have analyzed the stars by performing temperature and surface gravity fits to grids of pure hydrogen and helium atmospheres. Among the rare outliers are a set of presumed helium-core DA WDs with estimated masses below 0.3 solar masses, including two candidates that may be the lowest-mass WDs yet found.

60,,"This table contains the 5th Data Release Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR5 SDSS)/XMM-Newton Quasar Survey Catalog. This catalog contains 792 SDSS DR5 quasars with optical spectra that have been observed serendipitously in the X-rays with XMM-Newton. These quasars cover a redshift range of z = 0.11 - 5.41 and a magnitude range of i = 15.3 - 20.7. Substantial numbers of radio-loud (70) and broad absorption line (51) quasars exist within this sample.

Objects in this catalog are identified by matching the Swift pointings with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) quasar catalog. The final catalog contains 843 objects, among which 637 have both Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) observations and 354 of which are detected by both instruments. The overall X-ray detection rate is ~ 60% which rises to ~ 85% among sources with at least 10 ks of XRT exposure time. The authors construct the time-averaged spectral energy distribution (SED) for each of the 354 quasars using UVOT photometric measurements and XRT spectra. From model fits to these SEDs, they find that the big blue bump contributes about ~ 0.3 dex to the quasar luminosity. The authors re-visit the alpha&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt; - L&lt;sub&gt;2500A&lt;/sub&gt; relation by selecting a clean sample with only Type 1 radio-quiet quasars; the dispersion of this relation is reduced by at least 15% compared with studies that use non-simultaneous UV/optical and X-ray data.

This quasar sample was compiled in the following steps: 1. Candidate objects for the catalog were selected as any SDSS DR5 quasar that lie within 20 arcminutes of the center of the Swift FOV in any pointing from launch through 2008 June. 2. XRT data were processed to obtain X-ray count rates, spectra, and spectral parameters. 3. UVOT data were processed to obtain UV and optical photometry. 4. UVOT photometry were supplemented with measurements at other wavelengths from published catalogs. 5. Quasar SEDs were constructed. 6. Additional parameters were calculated based on the SEDs of each quasar. The raw sample is constructed by matching 3.5 years Swift pointings and the SDSS DR5 quasar catalog and contains 1034 objects. This HEASARC version of this catalog contains all 1034 objects in the &quot;raw&quot; catalog.

64,,"This table contains results from the analysis of a sample of 383 X-ray selected galaxy groups and clusters with spectroscopic redshift measurements (up to z ~ 0.79) from the 2XMMi/SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey. The X-ray cluster candidates were selected as serendipitously detected sources from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog that were located in the footprint of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR7). The cluster galaxies with available spectroscopic redshifts were selected from the SDSS-DR10. The authors developed an algorithm for identifying the cluster candidates that are associated with spectroscopically targeted luminous red galaxies and for constraining the cluster spectroscopic redshift. A cross-correlation of the constructed cluster sample with published optically selected cluster catalogs yielded 264 systems with available redshifts. The present redshift measurements (presented in reference paper III) are consistent with the published values. The current cluster sample extends the optically confirmed cluster sample from the authors&#39; cluster survey by 67 objects. Moreover, it provides spectroscopic confirmation for 78 clusters among their published cluster sample, which previously had only photometric redshifts. Of the new cluster sample that comprises 67 systems, 55 objects are newly X-ray discovered clusters and 52 systems are sources newly discovered as galaxy clusters in optical and X-ray wavelengths. Based on the measured redshifts and the fluxes given in the 2XMMi-DR3 catalogue, the authors have estimated the X-ray luminosities and masses of the cluster sample.

65,,"The authors have compiled a sample of X-ray-selected galaxy groups and clusters from the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (2XMMi-DR3) with optical confirmation and redshift measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In their paper, they present an analysis of the X-ray properties of this new sample with particular emphasis on the X-ray luminosity-temperature (L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; - T) relation. The X-ray cluster candidates were selected from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog in the footprint of the SDSS-DR7. The authors developed a finding algorithm to search for overdensities of galaxies at the positions of the X-ray cluster candidates in the photometric redshift space and to measure the redshifts of the clusters from the SDSS data. For optically confirmed clusters with good quality X-ray data, they derived the X-ray flux, luminosity, and temperature from proper spectral fits, while the X-ray flux for clusters with low-quality X-ray data was obtained from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalogue. The detection algorithm provides the photometric redshift of 530 galaxy clusters. Of these, 310 clusters have a spectroscopic redshift for at least one member galaxy. About 75 percent of the optically confirmed cluster sample are newly discovered X-ray clusters. Moreover, 301 systems are known as optically selected clusters in the literature while the remainder are new discoveries in X-ray and optical bands. The optically confirmed cluster sample spans a wide redshift range 0.03 to 0.70 (median z = 0.32). In this paper, they present the catalog of X-ray-selected galaxy groups and clusters from the 2XMMi/SDSS galaxy cluster survey. The catalog has two subsamples: (i) a cluster sample comprising 345 objects with their X-ray spectroscopic temperature and flux from the spectral fitting; (these objects are identified by having values for the table_sample parameter of 1 in this HEASARC implementation of the catalog) and (ii) a cluster sample consisting of 185 systems with their X-ray flux from the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog, because their X-ray data are insufficient for spectral fitting (these objects are identified by having values for the table_sample parameter of 2 herein). For each cluster, the catalog also provides the X-ray bolometric luminosity and the cluster mass at R&lt;sub&gt;500&lt;/sub&gt; based on scaling relations and the position of the likely brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The updated L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; - T relation of the current sample with X-ray spectroscopic parameters is presented in the paper. The authors found the slope of the L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; - T relation to be consistent with published ones. They see no evidence for evolution in the slope and intrinsic scatter of the L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; - T relation with redshift when excluding the low-luminosity groups.
